# Average-Grades-CPLus

Project 1 - Arrays

You will be given two data files, one with a list of names and one with a list of three grades per row. The
list of names in the first file represent students. The list of grades in the second file represent the grades
for each student (they are parallel arrays). The goal is to read the student names and grades, calculate
their averages, determine their letter grades and produce a report.
